About The Game

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that is typically played between two or more players. The game's objective is to guess a secret word chosen by one player (the "word setter") within a certain number of attempts. The other player (or players) attempt to guess the word by suggesting letters one at a time. For each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure (often resembling a hanged person) is drawn. The drawing is usually displayed on paper, a chalkboard, or a digital screen. The game continues until either the secret word is completely guessed, or the full stick figure is drawn, indicating the loss of the game.

Here's how the game generally works:

Setting Up the Game:

One player (the "word setter") thinks of a secret word and determines the maximum number of incorrect guesses allowed (commonly represented by the number of body parts on the hangman figure, typically around 6 to 8).
The other player (the "guesser") is unaware of the secret word and begins by suggesting a letter they believe might be in the word.
Guessing Letters:

The guesser suggests a letter that they think might be in the secret word.
If the suggested letter is in the secret word, all instances of that letter are revealed in the appropriate positions.
Incorrect Guesses:

If the suggested letter is not in the secret word, the word setter increments the count of incorrect guesses and starts drawing the hangman figure.
The drawing typically progresses from the head, body, arms, legs, and additional features like eyes, mouth, and so on.
Winning or Losing:

The game continues with the guesser suggesting letters until either they successfully guess the entire word (winning the game) or the hangman figure is fully drawn (losing the game).
The challenge for the guesser is to deduce the secret word by suggesting letters that are likely to be in the word. As incorrect guesses accumulate, the drawing of the hangman figure slowly takes shape, adding an element of suspense and urgency to the game. The word setter, on the other hand, must choose a word that is neither too easy nor too difficult for the guesser to figure out.

Hangman is often played for fun and to challenge players' vocabulary and deductive skills. It's a simple yet engaging word game that has been enjoyed by people of all ages for generations.
